# Star Explorer

**Star Explorer** is an interactive web application that allows users to explore different star types and learn more about them. This project was created as my final project for a **JavaScript Programming class**, combining my interest in astronomy and web development!

## Features

- Clickable images of various star types, each linking to more detailed information/images about that star type.
- A user-friendly interface created with **HTML** and **JavaScript**.
- Information about each star type, including general facts and characteristics.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – For structuring the webpage.
- **JavaScript** – To make the star types interactive and display additional information when clicked.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haley-B/star-explorer.git
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more star types and more detailed information.
- Improve the design with a more modern/user-friendly layout and styling.
